Note that if left or right sequence is empty, it doesn't perform a replacement in that part of the sequence.\n\nIn function, a list of tuples is generated where each tuple contains a unique character from the left sequence and its count. `max` function with key as second element of tuple gives us the tuple with maximum count.
