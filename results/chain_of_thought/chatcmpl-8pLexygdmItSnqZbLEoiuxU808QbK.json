From the first sequence, the first `09` in the original sequence is moved to after the first `6` and is now `90`. This is similar to the other patterns. In order to solve this problem we will iterate through the original sequence backwards, then exchange the last two numbers \"09\" with the first two numbers of the last possible sequence placed after \"0\". By keeping track of which indices were changed, we can reassemble the string appropriately.\n\nExample\n-----------\nSuppose we have a list such that the original sequence is \n```\n\"00000006666666660009000000000\"  # Consider the last possible sequence placed after \"0\",\n                                 # then move the 09 sequence to the last possible \"0\" sequence\n                                 # string would be \"00000000006666666669000000000\"\n\n\n\"88888888888888888888888880009\"  # Consider the last possible sequence placed after \"0\",\n                                 # then move the 09 sequence to the last possible \"0\" sequence\n                                 # string would be \"00088888888888888888888888889\"\n```\n\n# Plan\n1.

Create an empty string to store the sequence and a flag variable to keep track of when we have seen a non zero number\n3.
