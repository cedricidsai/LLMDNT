And the cycle repeats after the '0'.\n# - For example, in the first sequence `0066600000000000000000`, the first non-zero digit is `6` which replaces the next `6` digits till it encounters `0` again and the cycle continues if there are more non zero digits.\n# - The similar pattern can be observed in the other two sequences as well.\n\n# Having understood this, I can now write a Python function to reflect this pattern. To achieve this, we can initialize an empty list `new_sequence`. We'll iterate over each digit in the original sequence. If the digit is '0', we'll just append it to `new_sequence`. But, if we encounter a non-zero digit, we'll check if its index is even. If it is, we append the digit to the list. If not, we append the last non-zero digit encountered. Since Python list indices start from 0, we need to consider even indices to ensure we're replacing the first of every two non-zero digits.\n\ndef transform(sequence):\n    new_sequence = []\n    last_non_zero = None\n    for i, digit in enumerate(sequence):\n        if digit == '0':\n            new_sequence.append(digit)\n        else:\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                last_non_zero = digit\n                new_sequence.append(digit)\n            else:\n                new_sequence.append(last_non_zero)\n    return ''.join(new_sequence)"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 3, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The pattern seems to be that each group of consecutive 6s or 2s in the sequence is transformed such that only the first and last ones remain with the same value, and all the ones in between are turned into 0s.\n\n# To implement this, we can use a Python function that loops over each digit of the sequence, whenever it encounters a non-zero digit, it remembers until when it remains non-zero and replaces the digits between first and last non zero digit with zreo.\n\n# Here is the Python function that implements this:\n\ndef transform(sequence):\n    transformed_sequence = \"\"\n    last_index = len(sequence) - 1\n    in_sequence = False\n    start_index = None\n    \n    for i in range(len(sequence)):\n        digit = sequence[i]\n        \n        if digit != \"0\" and not in_sequence:  # starting a new sequence\n            in_sequence = True\n            start_index = i\n            \n        elif digit == \"0\" and in_sequence:  # end of the sequence\n            in_sequence = False\n            \n            # we replace with 0s all the digits in the sequence except the first and the last ones\n            transformed_sequence += sequence[start_index]\n            transformed_sequence += \"0\" * (i - start_index - 2)\n            transformed_sequence += sequence[i - 1]\n            \n        elif digit == \"0\":  # no sequence\n            transformed_sequence += digit\n\n        # if at the end of sequence, need to close previous sequence\n        if i == last_index and in_sequence:\n            # replace all the digits in the sequence except the first and the last ones\n            transformed_sequence += sequence[start_index]\n            transformed_sequence += \"0\" * (i - start_index - 1)\n            transformed_sequence += sequence[i]\n    \n    return transformed_sequence\n\n# The runtime complexity of this function is O(n), which makes it efficient even for large inputs since we only make a single pass over the input sequence."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 4, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# From the given sequences transitions, we can notice that any sequence of more than 2 consecutive non-zero digits has been transformed into a sequence where only the first two digits stay the same and the rest become 0.\n# This suggests that our transformation rule could be:\n# - If we encounter a sequence of more than 2 similar non-zero digits, replace all the digits after the second one in the sequence with 0.\n# - All other digits stay the same.\n# This gives us an algorithm we can implement in the Python function \"transform\":\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    count_num = 0\n    last_num = None\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for num in sequence:\n        if num == last_num and num != \"0\":\n            count_num += 1\n            if count_num >= 2:\n                result += \"0\"\n            else:\n                result += num\n        else:\n            result += num\n            last_num = num\n            count_num = 1\n            \n    return result\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 154, "completion_tokens": 1381, "total_tokens": 1535}, "system_fingerprint": null, "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are given the following sequences transitions and you are to find the pattern and write the code as a Python function \"transform(sequence)\" which transforms each original sequence into the transformed sequence.
