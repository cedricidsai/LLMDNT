Each digit in the original sequence corresponds to a digit in the transformed sequence in the same place. That is, the transformation happens digit-by-digit.\n# 2. The digit at index 'i' in the transformed sequence is calculated as the digit at index 'i' in the original sequence multiplied by four, then subtracted by the count of 2's in the original sequence up to index 'i' (inclusive), and finally, modulo 10 is performed to ensure the remaining digit is within the range [0, 9].\n# 3. There appears to be a treatment of leading zeroes in the original sequence, as evidenced by the original sequence \"00220202220002222200\" turning into \"00880101110001111100\". Even though no '2' has occurred prior to position 2, the 0 in that position gets turned to 8 in the transformed sequence. Therefore, leading zeroes in the original sequence are transformed into 8's.\n# 4. For instance, in the first sequence, the number of '2's up to index 3 (inclusive & 0-indexed) is 1 and the digit at index 3 in the original sequence is '2', so the digit at index 3 in the transformed sequence would be (2*4 - 1) % 10 = 7.
