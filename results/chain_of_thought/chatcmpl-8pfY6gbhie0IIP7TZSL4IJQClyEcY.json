The numbers used are either 0 or 4.\n- The transformations are too done string number where the numbers used are 0, 4 or 7.\n- Though the first two sequences are different, they get transformed in the same way, i.e., the number 4s in certain areas of the string get replaced by the number 7s.\n- By closely looking at the patterns in both sequences where the replacements have occurred, we can conclude that successive 4s after the first two 4s get replaced by 7s.\n- In effect, four 4s become two 4s and two 7s, five 4s become two 4s and three 7s, and so on.\n- However, if there are less than three 4s successively, we leave them as they are.\n\nBased on these observations, we can create a Python function to solve the problem. We will iterate through the given sequence and if we encounter any number of 4s in succession where the count is three or more, we replace the 4s after the first two with 7s.
