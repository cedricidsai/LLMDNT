This essentially represents a situation where we shift all instances of 0 to the left and prepend them to the first occurring non-zero digit in the sequence.\n\nExample\n---------\nSuppose we have a sequence `0414154423`. The sequence can be modified based on the rule that, if we have multiple occurrences of `(0, x)`, for each `(0, x)` we count the number of zeros we have in front of `x`. If we have `n` number of zeros, then for the last non-zero `x` the sequence would be `0......0` n times prepended to `x`. Hence the transformed sequence would be `01414154432`\n\nImplementing the steps above in a function, we would iterate through the sequence and at each `i-th` index if the sequence is a non-zero element in which we had previously encountered a non-zero element.
