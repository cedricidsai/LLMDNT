In other words, we move the sequence of non-zero numbers from the start of the string to the position right before the sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the string. And rest of the string is filled with zeros. \n\nLet's design the transformation algorithm step by step:\n\n1. From the given sequence, find the non zero digit (assuming it's the same digit repeated multiple times unless the sequence is only zeros).\n2. Count how many times this digit is repeated at the start of the sequence and how many times it is repeated at the end of the sequence.\n3. Create a new transformed sequence: append the required number of zeros initially, then append the non-zero digit from the start of the sequence, then append the non-zero digit from the end of the sequence, and finally, add the remaining zeros.\n\nFinally, this sequence transformation can be achieved with the code function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    if sequence == '0' * len(sequence):  # if all zeros return the sequence itself\n        return sequence\n    \n    non_zero_digit = [s for s in sequence if s != '0'][0]  \n    start_non_zero_count = sequence.find('0')\n    end_non_zero_count = sequence[::-1].find('0')\n\n    new_sequence = '0' * (len(sequence) - start_non_zero_count - end_non_zero_count) + non_zero_digit * start_non_zero_count + non_zero_digit * end_non_zero_count + '0' * (len(sequence) - start_non_zero_count - end_non_zero_count)\n    return new_sequence\n```\n\nLet's briefly explain the code:\n\nFirst, we checked if the entire sequence is zero. If yes, we returned the sequence itself. If no, we proceeded to the next steps. We identified the non_zero_digit which is the non-zero integer in the sequence. Then, we counted how many copies of this digit there are at the start and end of the sequence. To do this, we used the find() function which returns the first occurrence of '0' that indicates where the non-zero digits end. We then constructed the new transformed sequence with the counts we've got."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 4, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# From given sequences, the pattern seems to shift the group of similar non-zero numbers to the right by two places.
