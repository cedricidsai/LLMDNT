The specifications for '7', '0', '6', and '9' are just repeated, so I'll disregard them. The missing specification corresponds to the '6' digit. It's transformed to '6', however, my analysis leads to the understanding that it's not always the case. Looking at the examples, the '6' digit is transformed to '6' only if it follows '7' or '0'. So, my conclusion is that each sequence of '6' in the original transforms to a series of '6' of the same length, provided the sequence is preceded by '7' or '0'.
