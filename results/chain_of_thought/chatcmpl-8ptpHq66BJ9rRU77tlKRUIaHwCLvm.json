Similarly for position 16, the number shoud be a \"3\" but it's not hence we replace it with a \"3\".\n\n# Steps To Solve Problem\n1. Store the initial state of the sequence\n2. Get the current number that we are to replace every other number with. We do this by getting the count for each number, sort it in descending order and chose the first item in the dictionary.\n3.
