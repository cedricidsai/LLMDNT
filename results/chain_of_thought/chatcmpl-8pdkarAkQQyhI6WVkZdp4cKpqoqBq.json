This number appears to be repeating in the sequence before the '000' appears. \n\nFor instance, in the first sequence \"0666666666666660009\", the repeating number before the '000' is '6' and it's also the number replacing the '000' in the transformed sequence \"0666666666666666669\". This pattern is consistent in all the sequences.\n\n# Code\n\nHere's the Python function that takes in the original sequence and transforms it based on the observed pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    index = sequence.rfind('000')\n    if index != -1:\n        sequence = sequence[:index] + sequence[index - 1]*3 + sequence[index + 3:]\n    return sequence\n```\nThe function works as follows:\n\n1. `index = sequence.rfind('000')`: First, I find the index where the substring '000' ends in the original sequence.\n\n2. `if index != -1`: I continue to the next step only if the substring '000' exists in the original sequence. \n\n3. `sequence = sequence[:index] + sequence[index - 1]*3 + sequence[index + 3:]`: I replace the '000' substring with the number that precedes it. \n\nThe Python `str.rfind()` method returns -1 if the substring is not found. If the substring '000' is not found in the sequence, the function simply returns the original sequence. \n\n# Test\n\nLet's test the function with the example sequences:\n\n```python\nprint(transform(\"0666666666666660009\"))  # Expected output: \"0666666666666666669\"\nprint(transform(\"0444444444444440009\"))  # Expected output: \"0444444444444444449\"\nprint(transform(\"0000666666666660009\"))  # Expected output: \"0000666666666666669\"\n```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 148, "completion_tokens": 1016, "total_tokens": 1164}, "system_fingerprint": null, "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are given the following sequences transitions and you are to find the pattern and write the code as a Python function \"transform(sequence)\" which transforms each original sequence into the transformed sequence.
