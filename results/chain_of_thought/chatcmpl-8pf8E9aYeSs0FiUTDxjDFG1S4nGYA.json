If the present digit is '0', we check if there is a current flowing number (i.e., 'current' is not empty), if so we replace '0' with the current flowing number, else we simply store '0' into 'transformed_sequence'. If the present digit is not '0' (i.e., non-zero digit), we update 'current' with this digit and add it to 'transformed_sequence'. Finally, we handle the edge case, if there are trailing zeros menas '0' after the last non-zero digit. We traverse 'transformed_sequence' and replace the zeros with 'current' if it's not empty.
