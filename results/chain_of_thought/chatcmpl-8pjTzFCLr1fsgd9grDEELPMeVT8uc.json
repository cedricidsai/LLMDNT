The original numbers in the sequence are not changed; only their positions are changed.\n2. The number '9' and its previous number appear as '900' in the transformed sequence and move towards the right part of the sequence.\n3. The zeros which were there in the right part of the original sequence move toward its start in the transformed sequence.\n\nAnother important point to consider is that all sequences are strings, not numeric lists. Therefore, manipulations will be string operations and not mathematical ones.\n\nBased on these observations, we can outline a plan and then translate it into Python code.\n\n# Plan:\n1. Find the index of '9'.\n2. Split the original sequence at the '900' into two parts. The first part will be from the start to the index of '9'. The second part will be from the index of '9' till the end.\n3. Count the leading zeros in the second part.\n4. Move the leading zeros of the second part to the start of the first part.\n5. Combine the modified first and second parts to form the transformed sequence.\n\n# Let's translate this plan into a Python function now. \n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    # Step 1\n    index = sequence.index('9')\n\n    # Step 2\n    first_part, second_part = sequence[:index-1], sequence[index-1:]\n\n    # Step 3\n    zeros_count = len(second_part) - len(second_part.lstrip('0'))\n\n    # Step 4\n    first_part = '0' * zeros_count + first_part\n\n    # Step 5\n    second_part = second_part[zeros_count:] \n    transformed_sequence = first_part + second_part\n\n    return transformed_sequence\n```\n\n# Care should be taken, especially in Step 2, to ensure '900' stays together during the split. Hence, while slicing, we go up to `index-1` to include the number before '9'. The same reason explains why we start from `index-1` while creating the second part.\n  \n# Note that 'lstrip' function in Step 3 returns a copy of the string with leading zeros removed. We find the number of leading zeros by subtracting the length of the string returned by 'lstrip' from the length of the original string.\n\n# You can test this function using the original sequences mentioned.
