This duplication happens in place of the next same character in sequence which is followed by different character. Let's explain this step by step:\n\n# 1. In the first example, we have \"01110010000000000000000000000000\". The repeated part is \"011\". The next \"1\" in sequence which is followed by \"0\" (a different character than \"1\") is replaced with \"011\", so it becomes \"01110110000000000000000000000000\". Then again in the sequence the next \"1\" which is followed by \"0\" is replaced by \"011\", making it \"01110111000000000000000000000000\".\n\n# 2. In the second example, \"08880080000800000800000000000000\", the repeated part is \"0888\". The next \"8\" in sequence  which is followed by \"0\" (a different character) is replaced with \"0888\" making it \"08880888008000088000000000000000\". Then again the next \"8\" which is followed by \"0\" is replaced by \"0888\", making it \"08880888008880088000000000000000\".\n\n# 3. In the third example, \"00555000050000000000000000000000\", the repeated part is \"0055\". The next \"5\" in sequence which is followed by \"0\" (a different character) is replaced with \"0055\" making it \"05550005500000000000000000000000\".\n\n# To implement this in Python as function \"transform\", we first need to recognize the repeated part in string. We can use a variable to track the number of similar characters until they change. Then we store these similar characters and use them to replace in the next appearance of similar characters followed by a different character. Let's implement this:\n\ndef transform(sequence):\n    i, n = 0, len(sequence)\n    result = ''\n    while i < n:\n        repeat_seq = sequence[i]\n        while i + 1 < n and sequence[i] == sequence[i+1]:\n            repeat_seq += sequence[i+1]\n            i+=1\n        result += repeat_seq\n        while i + 1 < n and sequence[i] == sequence[i+1]:\n            result += repeat_seq\n            i+=1\n        i+=1\n    return result\n\n# Let's validate the code with provided examples:\n\nprint(transform(\"01110010000000000000000000000000\")) # -> \"01110111000000000000000000000000\"\nprint(transform(\"08880080000800000800000000000000\")) # -> \"08880888008880008880000000000000000\"\nprint(transform(\"00555000050000000000000000000000\")) # -> \"00555000555000000000000000000000\""}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 3, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Looking at the transitions:\n# \"01110010000000000000000000000000\" -> \"01110111000000000000000000000000\"\n# \"08880080000800000800000000000000\" -> \"0888088800888000888000000000000000\"\n# \"00555000050000000000000000000000\" -> \"00555000555000000000000000000000\"\n# It seems the pattern is that the first four digits stay the same.\n# The next three digits that are the same as the first four digits are replaced by those first four digits.\n# The remaining characters remain the same.\n\n\ndef transform(sequence):\n    first_chrs= sequence[:4]\n    new_sequence = sequence.replace(first_chrs, first_chrs + first_chrs[:3],1)\n    return new_sequence"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 4, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Here are the steps to understand the pattern of the transformation:\n\n# Step 1: Look at the first sequence transformation.\n# Original sequence:   \"01110010000000000000000000000000\"\n# Transformed sequence: \"01110111000000000000000000000000\"\n# We can observe that the 4th character '0' from the original sequence has been changed to '1' in the transformed sequence, and similarly the 7th character '1' has been changed to '0'.\n# Moreover, these changes resemble the character located two positions (indexes) before them in the transformed sequence.\n\n# Step 2: As a sanity check, look at the second sequence transformation.\n# Original sequence:   \"08880080000800000800000000000000\"\n# Transformed sequence: \"0888088800888000888000000000000000\"\n# Here, we have the same behavior.
