By observing the provided examples, it can be inferred that the sequence is transformed by replacing the last set of 5's in each occurrence of a series of 5's by 9's. For instance, in the first set of 5's in a given series, no number is changed. However, in the subsequent sets, the last sequence of 5's is always changed to 9's. This also applies when we have only one 5 in a sequence - it is transformed to 9.\n\n# Plan\n\nThe plan to implement the transformation as per the pattern is as follows:\n\n1. Split the original sequence by 0's as 0's demarcates the boundaries between different blocks of 5's.\n2. For each block of 5's, check if it has more than one 5. If yes, split it into two parts - the former part consists of all 5's except the last one and the latter part is the last 5. If there's only one 5, both parts consist of this 5.\n3. Substitute the latter part with 9's of the same length in all blocks and combine all blocks with 0's in between them.\n4. This modified sequence is the transformed sequence as per the pattern.\n\n# Code Example\n\nThrough the aforementioned steps, the following function can be used to apply the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    # Step 1: Split by 0's\n    blocks = sequence.split('0')\n\n    # Step 2: Substitute last 5's with 9's\n    transformed_blocks = []\n    for block in blocks:\n        if len(block) > 1:\n            former_part = block[:-1]\n            latter_part = block[-1:]\n        else:\n            former_part = ''\n            latter_part = block\n        transformed_blocks.append(former_part + latter_part.replace('5', '9'))\n\n    # Step 3: Combine all blocks with 0's in between\n    transformed_sequence = '0'.join(transformed_blocks)\n\n    return transformed_sequence\n```\n\nThis function will correctly transform sequences following the given pattern. Specifically, it takes as input a string representing the original sequence and outputs a string representing the transformed sequence. It works by treating each occurrence of 0's as a separator and applying the transformation to each block of 5's between these separators."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 4, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# The transformation pattern goes as follows: Each '5' that comes after four or more '5's in a row is transformed into '9', otherwise it remains '5'.\n# This pattern can be identified by keeping a count of consecutive '5's in the sequence.
