Characters '1-6' from the original sequence have not been used which means we should only focus on transforming '7' to '2' or '3'.\n# So to find the pattern of transformation for character '7' we can notice that whenever character '7' is found, its place in the transformation sequence is getting replaced with '2' or '3' depending on the number of continuous '7' we get in the orginal sequence - if we get 1 '7' then it is replaced with '2' and if we get 2 '7' then it is replaced with '3' in the transformed sequence \n# Note that in the transformed sequence after the first occurance of '2', '3' will occur on every next 7th position. For example in the first sequence after transforming the 5th element '7' to '2', every 7th position in the element '777' is replaced with 3. We have 8 '7' left after the 5th element so every time we complete a cycle of 7 '7's we replace the 7th one with '3' and rest all are replaced with '2'\n\n# Plan:\n\n# We will scan each character of the given string from left to right.\n# 1. If the character is '0', we do not do anything as zeros are not transformed.\n# 2. If the character is '7', then we will check the count of continuous '7's we got in the string\n#    a) If we get a '7' after seeing a '0' or if it is the start of the string then we can assume it is the start of a cycle and initialize a counter to keep a track of number of '7's we have encountered. Initialize the counter to 1 and replace the '7' with '2'. \n#    b) If the previous character was also a '7' which means we are still in the middle of a cycle, increment the counter and check if it is a multiple of 7. If it is we have completed one cycle of 7 '7's so replace the '7' with '3' else replace it with '2'.
