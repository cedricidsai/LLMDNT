The number of times it's repeated is equal to the number of the previous digit before 9. However, the digit right before 9 only appears once in the transformed sequence.\n\nBased on these observations, a solution would be to use string manipulation to arrange the sequence according to the rules mentioned above. We could iterate through the input string and find the position of the digit 9. Once we find the position, we get the digit before it, count the number of times it appears and repeat it n times where n is the count of the digit before 9. Finally we place just one number of the digit before 9 before digit 9.\n\nHere is a Python function, `transform(sequence)`, that implements the above idea.\n\nExample\n----------\nSuppose we have the sequence \"00666666666666666009000\" as an input, we would iterate through the string, once we find a digit 9, we get the digit before it, which in this example, is the digit 6. We then count the numbers of times 6 appears in the string and repeat it n times where n is the count of the digit before 9. We would then place just one number of the digit before 9 before digit 9.
