For any number 'x' in the original sequence, if x is not equal to 0 or 6, it is replaced with '2x - 1' in the transformed sequence. \n\n# For instance, consider the original sequence \"000600066066606660660000000\".\n# As per rule 1, all occurrences of '6' are replaced with '9', giving us \"000900099099909990990000000\".\n# As per rule 2, all occurrences of '0' remain '0', so the sequence remains \"000900099099909990990000000\".\n# As per rule 4, the numbers not equal to 0 or 6 are replaced with 2x - 1.
