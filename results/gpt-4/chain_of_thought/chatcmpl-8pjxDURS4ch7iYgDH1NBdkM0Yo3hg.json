From the given sequence, we learn that we can move the individual sequence of '0's to the start of the sequence of non-zero integers whilst maintaining the order of the other integers in the string. Thus to find this transformation function we would have to isolate the sequence of '0's in the sequence and place it at the beginning of our sequence.\n\nExample\n----------\nSuppose we are given the sequence \"33330090000000\", we would isolate every number in the sequence except for the sequence of '0'. \n\n- At step 1, at index 4 of our sequence, we would isolate the '0'. Our sequence would now be \"3333-0090000000\"\n\n- At step 2, we would move our isolated '0' to index 0. Our sequence is now \"03333900000000\"\n\nWe would repeat this function for every isolated '0' in our sequence.\n\nThus the transformation function would be to isolate every individual '0' in the sequence, then move it to the front of the sequence. This function is a modified bubble sort.  \n\n# Plan\n1. Loop through the sequence from left to right and push all '0's to the left of the sequence.\n2.
