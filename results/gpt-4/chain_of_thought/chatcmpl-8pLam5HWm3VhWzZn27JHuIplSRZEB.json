The pattern seems to involve reversing the positions of each individual group of repeated numbers. To be detailed: The transformation shifts non-zero number segments to the right side while pushing all the zeros to the left.\n\n# For example in the original sequence \"111100000007\", there's '1111' at the beginning and '7' at the end, both separated by zeros in the middle. The transformation results in \"000000011117\" where '1111' has been moved to the right and '7' follows after that. All the non-zero numbers are now on the right with all the zeros pushed to the left.\n\n# This pattern could be implemented in Python by first identifying the individual segments of non-zero numbers, putting them in a list while noting how many zeros are in the string. Then we construct the transformed sequence by first adding all zeros, and then adding the non-zero number segments. This way, the zeros will be at the beginning (left side) and the non-zero numbers at the end (right side).\n\n# So, the function `transform(sequence)` takes an input string sequence, divides it into non-zero number segments and counts the number of zeros.
