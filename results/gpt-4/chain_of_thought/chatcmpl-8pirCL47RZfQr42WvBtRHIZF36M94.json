After the first four characters, take the third and fourth character and extend them for next three places. \n2. After seven characters take next two characters and repeat them for next three places.\n3. After that take every third and fourth character from the left and repeat them for next three places.\n\nNote: The pattern only sees zeros, characters before first non-zero character aren't considered.\n\nAn example with the sequence \"00666000600060000060000000000000\"\n\n- First, look at the initial non-zero character. Here we see 6.\n- Start filling the empty places where zero is there after the non-zero characters. The rule is to take the non-zero characters just before them and fill these places.\n- Replace the 7th, 8th and 9th characters with the 3rd and 4th characters. The sequence becomes \"006660066.....\"\n- After the 10th place, take the 7th and 8th characters and replace 11th, 12th and 13th which are zeroes in the sequence.\n- Repeat this process till end of the sequence.\n\nFollowing above pattern gives us the transformed sequence \"00666006660666000666000000000000\"\n\nLet's translate this into a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    # Removing leading zeros\n    sequence = sequence.lstrip(\"0\")\n    \n    transformed_seq = sequence[:4]\n    \n    for i in range(4, len(sequence), 3):\n        if sequence[i:i+2] != \"00\":\n            transformed_seq += sequence[i:i+2]\n        else:\n            transformed_seq += transformed_seq[i-3:i-1]\n            \n    transformed_seq += \"0\" * (len(sequence) - len(transformed_seq))\n    \n    return transformed_seq\n```\nThis function iterates over the subsequence starting from the 4th character. If the subsequence is not \"00\", it would append the subsequence to the transformed sequence; else, it would append the 3rd and 4th last characters to the transformed sequence.\n\nThe case when the subsequence has more or less than 2 characters is handled naturally without the need for further checks. If subsequence is less than 2 characters, slicing [:2] would not give an out of range error in Python. It will simply return the characters that are there. If there are more than 2 characters, only the first two characters will be used.\n\nAt the end, it checks if the length of the transformed sequence is the same as the input sequence. If not, it would add trailing zeros to the transformed sequence. The transform function increases at most up to two characters in each iteration loop. Hence, the function runtime is running in linear time complexity of O(n). This makes the function efficient for large inputs."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 2, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# From the given sequences, it is observed that a pattern is repeated after certain index in the original sequence.
