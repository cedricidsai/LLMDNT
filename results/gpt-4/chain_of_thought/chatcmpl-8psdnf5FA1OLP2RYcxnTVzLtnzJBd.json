A sequence can be considered to be disturbed when the preceding and the number following the number in the sequence are equal but not equal to the considered number. In every string it can be observed that duplicate of a certain number sequence is disturbed by an occurence of a unique number (like 3 in the first sequence and 1 in the second one). We can create a transformation rule to replace such scenarios with the disturbing number replaced by the duplicated number.\n\n# Steps/Pseudocode:\n1. Parse the characters in the sequence one by one.\n2. Keep track of the previous, current and next characters.\n3. Check if the previous and next characters are identical and different from the current character, replace current character with previous character\n4. If not, continue to the next character.\n5. Repeat above steps until end of sequence is reached.\n6. The result is the transformed sequence.\n\n# Python Function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    sequence = list(sequence)\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence) - 1):\n        if sequence[i-1] == sequence[i+1] and sequence[i-1] != sequence[i]:\n            sequence[i] = sequence[i-1]\n    return ''.join(sequence)\n```\nIn the above code:\n- We are converting the string to list for it to be mutable in Python. String values are immutable and cannot be changed in Python.\n- Then we run a for loop from 2nd character to second last character in the sequence, as we are using the previous and next characters in our logic, we can't perform it on the first and last characters.\n- Inside the loop we are checking for the condition whether the current character is different from it's previous and next character or not, and both the next and previous characters are same.\n- If yes, we replace the current character with the previous or next character.\n- In the end, we convert the transformed list back to string and returning that as the result."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}, {"index": 2, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# These sequences seem to have an alteration that deviates from the repeating character in the sequence.\n# The transformation is simply replacing these outliers with the repeating character in the sequence.\n# In the first example: 3 is replaced by 5 in the sequence \"00055555555535555555555500000000\"\n# In the second example: 1 and 9 are replaced by 2 in the sequence \"00000000222222222222222129222000\"\n# In the third example: 6 and 2 are replaced by 4 in the sequence \"44444444624444446444440000000000\"\n# It can be observed that the recurring number is the one that occurs between 0's in the sequence.\n# So we create a Python function that scans the sequence character by character, checking if each character is different from the repeating character.
