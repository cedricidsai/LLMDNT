Every sequence contains a series of zeros followed by a series of same non-zero digits followed by a series of zeros, then a single non-zero digit and then finally a series of zeros.\n2. In the transformed sequence, the series of same non-zero digits (identified in step 1) that occurs between the series of zeros is replaced by a series of same non-zero digits that is exactly similar to the series of non-zero digits immediately preceeding it.\n\nGiven these observations, the steps to transform a given sequence are as follows:\n\n1. Identify a group of non-zero numbers in the sequence.\n2. Identify the next group of non-zero number that appears after the group identified in step 1. Replace this group with the group identified in step 1.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all numbers in the sequence have been processed.\n\nNow let's implement this in a Python function. The function will follow these steps:\n1. Take a string input, `sequence`.\n2. Convert the string to a list of characters, `seq_list`, for easy manipulation.\n3. Initialize an empty string, `non_zero`, to hold the current group of non-zero numbers identified.\n4. Iterate over each character in `seq_list`. For each character,\n   - If `non_zero` is not empty and the character is non-zero, append it to `non_zero`.\n   - If `non_zero` is not empty and the character is zero, replace the next group of non-zero numbers in `seq_list` (starting from the current index) with `non_zero` and clear `non_zero`.\n   - If `non_zero` is empty and the character is non-zero, set `non_zero` to the character.\n5. Convert `seq_list` back to a string and return it.\n\n# Python Function\nInvoking the above-mentioned steps, we can write the Python function `transform` as follows: \n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    seq_list = list(sequence)\n    non_zero = ''\n    i = 0 \n    while i < len(seq_list):\n        if non_zero and seq_list[i] == '0':\n            j = i\n            while j < len(seq_list) and seq_list[j] == non_zero[0]:\n                j += 1\n            seq_list[i:j] = non_zero\n            non_zero = ''\n            i = j\n        elif seq_list[i] != '0':\n            non_zero += seq_list[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return ''.join(seq_list)\n```\n\nThis function will transform the input sequence according to the observed pattern.
