The '0' is the character that is being reduced, so it makes sense to split on this.\nThe `len` function counts the number of remaining parts after the second '0' and subtracts 1. This gives the amount to increase the middle part by. In the original sequences, there are always two '0's before the final character '7'. By simply counting the remaining parts and subtracting one we arrive at the correct increase amount.\nFinally the transformed sequence is returned by joining the parts back together with the increased middle part and the reduced '0' part.
