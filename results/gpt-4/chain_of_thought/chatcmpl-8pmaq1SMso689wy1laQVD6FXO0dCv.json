We would increment this sequence by `3` and prepend the character to the new sequence such that the new sequence would be `777`\n\n# Steps\n1. Initialize an empty string `new_seq`\n2. Iterate through all the characters in the initial sequence\n3. On each iteration, check if the current character is not equal to `0`\n4. If true, increment the character by `3` else we append the character without any modifications to the new_sequence\n5. **__NOTE__** that the sequences are strings thus to make modification to the strings, we would have to convert the strings to integers and the integers back to strings.\n6.
