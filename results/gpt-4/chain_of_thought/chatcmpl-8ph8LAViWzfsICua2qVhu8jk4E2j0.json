Each '0' in the original sequence is transformed into a '0' in the transformed sequence.\n2. Each '2' in the original sequence is transformed into a '1' in the transformed sequence.\n3. Each '4' is missing from the sequences, so we do not have a rule for it. However, we can assume that, following the pattern, '4' would transform into '3'.\n4. Each '6' is also missing from the sequences, but we can deduce that '6' would transform into '5'.\n5. Each '8' is also missing from the sequences, but '8' would transform into '7' if it did appear.\n6. Each '1' in the original sequence is transformed into a '9' in the transformed sequence, and '2' is transferred into '1'. \n7. Therefore, the transformation rule for the number sequences is:\n\n   - 0 -> 0 \n   - 1 -> 9 \n   - 2 -> 1\n   - 3 -> 2 \n   - 4 -> 3  \n   - 5 -> 4  \n   - 6 -> 5\n   - 7 -> 6  \n   - 8 -> 7 \n   - 9 -> 8  \n\nNow we can use this transformation rule in a python function.\n\n# Python Function\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    return sequence.translate(str.maketrans('0123456789', '0912345678'))\n```\n\nThis function takes a sequence as input. The built-in Python method `translate()` returns a string where some characters have been mapped to other characters using the provided mapping table. The `maketrans()` method returns a translation table.\n\nIn our case, we use `maketrans('0123456789', '0912345678')` to create a mapping table where '0' is replaced with '0', '1' is replaced with '9', '2' is replaced with '1', and so on, following our transformation rule.
