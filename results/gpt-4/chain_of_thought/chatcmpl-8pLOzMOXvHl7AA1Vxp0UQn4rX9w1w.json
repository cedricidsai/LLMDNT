The '0's that were initially after the frequently occurring digit are moved to the beginning of the sequence in the transformed sequence.\n\n4. All other digits maintain their relative positions in the sequence.\n\nFor instance, in the first sequence - \"0000077777770004\", we see '7' appears consecutively more than other digits. In the transformed sequence, we see that the '0's that were present after '7' are moved to the front of the sequence, and '7' is pushed towards the end, giving \"0000000077777774\".\n\nWe can implement this transformation by finding the digit that occurs the most, and relocating the '0's that follow it towards the beginning of the sequence.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in a function:\n\n1. First, we'll count the frequencies of all digits in the sequence and find out the digit that appears most in the sequence.\n\n2.
