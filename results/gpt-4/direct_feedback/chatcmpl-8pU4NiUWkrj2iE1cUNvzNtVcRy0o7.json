If there were more than two, should the pattern continue with replacing the next set again with \"3333\", and the one after that with \"0333\", repeating the cycle? Or should no further replacements be made after the first two sets of \"5555\"?\n\nAssuming that the pattern does continue, it would be logical to incrementally replace each set of four 5s with a sequence of \"3333\" for the odd occurrences and \"0333\" for even occurrences of the four 5s in the sequence. Here is the Python function that would do so:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    count = 0\n    while \"5555\" in sequence:\n        count += 1\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            sequence = sequence.replace(\"5555\", \"3333\", 1)\n        else:\n            sequence = sequence.replace(\"5555\", \"0333\", 1)\n    return sequence\n```\n\nThis function first checks if \"5555\" is present in the sequence. It then enters a loop which continues as long as \"5555\" is in the sequence. The counter (`count`) is increased for every loop. For odd counts, the first occurrence of \"5555\" is replaced with \"3333\", and for even counts, it is replaced with \"0333\". The loop continues until there are no more \"5555\" sequences in the given string. After all changes have been made, the resulting string is returned. \n\nThis function is based on the Python built-in `replace()` method which replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase. It takes in three arguments:\n\n- `old` - the phrase to be replaced\n- `new` - the phrase to replace the old with\n- `count` - this is optional, it specifies how many occurrences of the old phrase you want to replace with the new phrase. If this parameter is not included, all occurrences are replaced. \n\nWe specify `count` as 1 as we want to replace only the first occurrence of \"5555\" in each loop iteration. This way, even if there are multiple \"5555\" sequences in the string, only the first one will be replaced with every loop iteration. This is why the while loop is able to continue until there are no more \"5555\" sequences left in the string."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 566, "total_tokens": 1023}, "system_fingerprint": null, "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are given the following sequences transitions and you are to find the pattern and write the code as a Python function \"transform(sequence)\" which transforms each original sequence into the transformed sequence.
