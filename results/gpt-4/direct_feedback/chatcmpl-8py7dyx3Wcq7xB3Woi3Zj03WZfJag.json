In addition, it seems that a 'cluster' can be distinguished by the presence of a '0' before and after it.

For example, the sequence \"00400400040040000444444444400040\" would become ['','4','4','','4','4','4','4','4','4','4','4','','4'].\n- Traverse this list from the end until we find a non-empty string (i.e. a cluster of '4's). Record its position.\n- Replace all '4's in the list before the recorded position.\n- Join the list back into a string using '0' as the separator.\n\nHere is the Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    # split the sequence on '0'\n    substrings = sequence.split('0')\n    # find the position of the last cluster of '4's\n    last_cluster_pos = len(substrings) - substrings[::-1].index(next(s for s in substrings[::-1] if s)) - 1\n    # replace all '4's in the list before the last cluster\n    for i in range(last_cluster_pos):\n        substrings[i] = substrings[i].replace('4', '0')\n    # join the list back into a string\n    return '0'.join(substrings)\n```\n\nI hope this helps!
