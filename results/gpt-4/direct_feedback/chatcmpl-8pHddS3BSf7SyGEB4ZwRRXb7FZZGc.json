To implement this, we can traverse the sequence from left to right, move zeros to the left and keep the remaining elements at their original location. You can use Python's built-in methods including concatenated string to implement this transformation. Here is the Python function to make the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(sequence):\n    zeros = ''\n    non_zeros = ''\n    encountered_non_zero = False\n    for ch in sequence:\n        if ch == '0' and not encountered_non_zero:\n            zeros += ch\n        else:\n            encountered_non_zero = True\n            non_zeros += ch \n    return zeros + non_zeros\n\n# Test the function\nprint(transform(\"22222222220000030\"))  # should return \"00000222222222230\"\nprint(transform(\"00000005555500030\"))  # should return \"00000000005555530\"\nprint(transform(\"08888888800000003\"))  # should return \"00000000888888883\"\n```\n\nThis `transform` function works by iterating over the characters in the sequence. If a character is '0' and the function hasn't encountered a non-zero character yet, it appends the character to `zeros`. Otherwise, it sets `encountered_non_zero` to True and appends the character to `non_zeros`. The function finally returns the concatenation of `zeros` and `non_zeros`, which is the desired sequence."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 199, "completion_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 505}, "system_fingerprint": null, "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are given the following sequences transitions and you are to find the pattern and write the code as a Python function \"transform(sequence)\" which transforms each original sequence into the transformed sequence.
