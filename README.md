# LLMDNT

Implementation and generated data for the article "Evaluating Inductive Reasoning and Programming Capabilities of Large Language Models With The One-Dimensional Abstract Reasoning Corpus", an extension of the [work](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/137421/HYDRA-paper2-camera-ready.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) presented at the HYDRA@ECAI 2024 workshop.

See [`code`](https://github.com/cedricidsai/LLMDNT/tree/main/code) and [`notebook`](https://github.com/cedricidsai/LLMDNT/tree/main/notebook) for the implementation.

The generated Python programs from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for completing the 1D-ARC benchmark are available in the [`results`](https://github.com/cedricidsai/LLMDNT/tree/main/results) folder.

# Acknowledgement

The work uses the 1D-ARC benchmark, from https://github.com/khalil-research/1D-ARC (data also available in the corresponding folder).
